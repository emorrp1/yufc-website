<h3 id="what">What is Ultimate?</h3>
<a class="left" target="_blank" href="http://ultimatephotos.org/uk-2008-roses/main/IMG_3308.jpg"><img alt="Choppers breaking a force" src="images/chopsbreak.jpg"/></a>
<p>
	Ultimate is a <b>fast-paced</b>, <b>non-contact</b>, <b>self-officiated</b> sport, played with 5 (indoor) or 7 (outdoor) players on each of <b>2 teams</b>.
	The aim of the game isn't too complicated: get the disc to opposition's <b>end zone</b>, without conceeding the disc to the other team. Simple isn't it'?
</p>
<p>
	The offensive team attempt to pass the disc up the pitch towards the end zone without dropping it.
	The defending team tries to stop the offensive team's progress.
	The disc changes hands in <i> Turn overs </i> when the defending team blocks or catches the disc, or the offensive team throws the disc away.
	Once "Turned Over" play re-commences straight away, with the defending team now on offence.
</p>

	See <a href="info.php#rules">Useful Info</a> for the finer details.

<h3 id="spirit">Spirit of the Game</h3>
<p>
	There are no referees in Ultimate.
	The players make their own foul calls and settle disputes according to procedures laid out in the Rules of Ultimate.
	Upholding the principles of fair play and "Spirit of the Game" during competition becomes a challenging responsibility for players and is one of the defining aspects of the sport.
