	York Ultimate excelled this Spring, reaching 6th in University Mixed Indoor Nationals in Glasgow, whilst winning the Spirit of the Game award and entering many other tournaments, both serious and fun!

	Thanks to an excellent elections evening, we now have a new <a href="about.html#committee">committee</a>, with all new captains to run training sessions.

	We're moving the Club mailing list from Yahoo Groups to York Lists, to make it easier for our freshers to manage. You can sign yourselves up <a href="https://lists.york.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/ultimate-club">here</a>.
